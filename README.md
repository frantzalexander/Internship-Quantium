- Difference in sample segment average purchase price : $0.34
- Sampling Standard Deviation: 0.0088

The 95% confidence interval for the average purchase price was between: $0.32 and $0.36

Significance Level: 5%
Null Hypothesis: We assume that there is no significant difference between the segments. 
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a significant difference. 


Conclusion: Reject the null hypothesis with a p-value result close to 0.  
- There is a significant difference in the average purchase price between the two customer segments. 

## Strategy Recommendation
### Lifestage Segments:

- Target marketing on older singles/couples, older families, retirees and young singles/couples segments:

### Consumer Segments:
- Attention should be on the Mainstream segment. 
- This segment drives the most sales revenue.

### Bag sizes:
- Focus marketing on the popular bag sizes which were 175, 150, 330, 380 and 270g.
- Promotions for 2 bag purchases per transaction, especially for larger bag sizes.

### Brands:
- Marketing centered on Kettle, Doritos, Smith's, Pringles and Twisties brands.

### Sales Trends:
- Sales promotions need to take place starting just before December holiday season.
